Build must retarget solution to SDK Version 10.0.17763.0

### Goal of the game
- You are the red car, trying to save as many blue souls that are spinning on the highway as possible. Zombies are out, and have cabs trying to sabotage you! Fortunately, you can shoot holy water out of your car to destroy them. However, make sure you don't hit the normal smaller pedestrians, or it's game over... Saving enough souls will progress you to the next level
